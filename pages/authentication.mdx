## Authentication API Overview

The Authentication API is responsible for managing user access to the application. It provides a secure and straightforward way to handle user registration, login, and session management. By using a token-based authentication system, the API ensures that all communication between the client and server is secure and that only authorized users can access protected resources.

### Key Features

- **User Registration**: Create a new user account with a secure password.
- **User Login**: Authenticate users and issue access and refresh tokens.
- **Token Management**: Refresh expired access tokens to maintain a seamless user experience.
- **Email Verification**: Verify a user's email address to activate their account.

Below is a summary of the available endpoints and their functionalities. Each endpoint is designed to be easy to integrate and follows best practices for security and user management.

### Endpoints

#### `POST /api/v1/auth/register`
- **Description**: Registers a new user account.
- **Usage**: This endpoint allows a new user to create an account by providing their full name, username, email, and password. Upon successful registration, the user will receive an email to verify their account.

#### `POST /api/v1/auth/login`
- **Description**: Logs in a user and returns a set of authentication tokens.

#### `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh`
- **Description**: Refreshes an expired access token.

#### `GET /api/v1/auth/verify`
- **Description**: Verifies a user's email address.
- **Usage**: After a user registers, they will receive an email with a verification link. This endpoint is called when the user clicks on the link, and it marks the user's email as verified, allowing them to access all features of the application.
