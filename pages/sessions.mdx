## Sessions API Overview

The Sessions API is a critical component for managing user authentication and security. It provides a comprehensive set of endpoints to retrieve, and revoke user sessions, giving you full control over who is accessing your application and from where. This is particularly useful for identifying suspicious activity, managing concurrent sessions, and allowing users to see where their account is being used.

### Key Features

- **Session Management**: Retrieve a list of all active and past user sessions.
- **Session Revocation**: Securely revoke individual or all user sessions.
- **Detailed Information**: Get detailed information about each session, including the user agent and IP location.

Below is a summary of the available endpoints and their functionalities. Each endpoint is designed to be easy to integrate and provides clear, consistent responses to help you build a secure and reliable authentication system.
