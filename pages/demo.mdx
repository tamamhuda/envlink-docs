## Authentication Guide

### Recommended: Google Sign-In

### Manual Registration

Use a non-primary email to avoid interfering with your production inbox. If you handle notifications during the demo, use your own personal email.

## Subscription Flow

### Option 1: Subscribe directly

User proceeds to subscription and completes payment in one flow.

### Option 2: Add payment method first

1. Add a payment method.
2. Add billing address.
3. Proceed to subscription.

### Test Cards (Xendit)

Use only test cards during demo. Avoid entering real personal or financial data.
